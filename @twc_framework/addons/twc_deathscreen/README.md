## Death Screen
TWC deathscreen handles the death screen (duh). The death screen informs the player of how they died, and gives them a moments reflection. The music that plays changes depending on their circumstance. Attempts to fade them into spectate, as opposed to a hard shunt.

## Death Types
* Instantly Killed
* Bled Out
* Cardiac Arrest
* Medication Overdose (defer which one, too)
* Clinical Death (aka no heart beating, no breathing - no CPR performed to replace this)
* Drowned
